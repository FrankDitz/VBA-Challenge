# VBA-Challenge
A million agonizing hours spent trying different codes out but I finally figured out how to use conditional loops.
Tried modeling the code for this challenge by using the Module 2.3 "Credit Card Activity" but trying to use the "Summary_Table_Row" variable to input values into the calculated variable portion of excel ended in disaster. Basically the code was running okay but the worksheets were getting jumbled and important ticker values were missing. I obtained help from the website https://excelchamps.com/vba/loop-sheets/ to help with running code through all worksheets properly. I also obtained help from students in the class and the slack tutors on how to use the j functionality for this challenge. I also was able to reference an "Arrays- For Loops in VBA" Stack Overflow found at this site https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64394196/for-loops-in-vba-initializing-variable. 
I am including my first attempt at this code titled: "VBA-Challenge First Attempt" just in case you are an angel and want to leave me a comment on where I went wrong. 
Thank You!
